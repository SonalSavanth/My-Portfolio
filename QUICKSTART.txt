# Quick Start Guide 🚀

## Step 1: Replace Placeholder Images

Your portfolio has placeholder images that need to be replaced with your actual images:

### 📸 Images to Replace:

1. **Nellikka Internship Image**
   - File: `images/nellikka.jpg`
   - What to use: Screenshot or photo from your internship
   - Recommended size: 800x600px or similar 4:3 ratio

2. **Mind-Works Project Image**
   - File: `images/mindworks.jpg`
   - What to use: Screenshot of your Mind-Works project
   - Recommended size: 800x600px or similar 4:3 ratio

### How to Replace:
1. Delete the current placeholder files
2. Add your images with the SAME filenames:
   - `nellikka.jpg`
   - `mindworks.jpg`
3. Make sure they're in the `images/` folder

**Note:** If you don't have images yet, the placeholders will work fine - they're colorful and clean!
